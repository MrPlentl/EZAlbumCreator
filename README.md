# EZAlbumCreator
### A tool for quickly deploying BASIC Photo Albums on a Web Page

### Currently Under Development

My biggest issue with image storage is the time that it takes to get a ton of my photos from my computer to my website.
With the EZAlbumCreator, you can upload a zipped file with all your images and it will finish by giving you code to embed on your webpage
that will display your album.

## The Goal
To take the pain out of publically posting Photo Albums to your Website.


## Reporting a bug

To report a bug simply create a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MrPlentl/EZAlbumCreator/issues/new) and describe
your problem or suggestion. I welcome all kinds of feedback regarding the
EZAlbumCreator process but not limited to:

 * When EZAlbumCreator doesn't work as expected
 * When EZAlbumCreator blows up and flatout doesn't work
 * When you simply want a new option or feature, though the point of this program is to get Photos to published Albums ASAP

Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets
that cover your issue. Feel free to shoot me a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/thabamboozlr/) if you just have a question.

I'm guessing I picked the right one, but basically, I don't care what you do with this code.


## The EZAlbumCreator Team

There is no "I" in Team... but in this case, it's just me. :) EZAlbumCreator is currently maintained by [Brandon Plentl](https://github.com/MrPlentl),
